Create unlimited content templates (supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Fantastic for creating blocks of content you want to add to one, or more, pages. Define content templates once, use anywhere!

== Description ==

Create unlimited content templates and add to any page, or multiple pages. Any change to a content template is automatically updated wherever it's used on your site. You only ever have to edit in one place! No more hunting around for all instances of content and updating multiple times.

The Contemplate plugin is great for things like adding banners, or content blocks that you duplicate throughout your site.

Anyone with a WordPress site will definitely benefit from this plugin. It's a great time-saver.

In case you are wondering, the plugin name is derived from: [Con]tent + [Template] = Contemplate

A lot of hard work goes into maintaining my FREE plugins. If you have a moment I'd really appreciate if you could rate the plugin and perhaps give it a review.

Also, why not take a look at our new <a href="https://www.wpgoplugins.com" target="_blank">WordPress plugin site</a> for more great plugins!
